# React Projects

This repository contains a collection of React projects that showcase my learning and growth with the React framework. Each project applies different aspects of React, from basic components to more advanced state management, routing, and API integration. This repo is a hands-on exploration of front-end development with React, and itâ€™s regularly updated as I continue to expand my skills.


## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Learning to build reusable, efficient components.
- **State Management**: Implementing both local state and state libraries like Redux or Context API.
- **Routing**: Navigating between pages with React Router.
